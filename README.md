# PyMaJORME

PyMaJORME is an acronyme for **Py**thon **Ma**kes **J**ava **O**bject-**R**elational **M**apping **E**asy.

The idea behind this project is to provide an environment to a developer for faster and bugfree developing of ORM layer for Java applications. As this job can be very annoying when implementing in Java from scratch, idea for this project came along. Who says that no good things come out from using Java :)

PyMaJORME is an easy to use python tool based on DSL's for generating ORM layer for Java applications. It is implemented entirely in python and provides specifically created DSL for describing Java entities and their relations. Then, entire ORM layer with model classes using appropriate JPA annotations, and optionally DAO layer, can be generated along with necessary configuration files.

This project is also used as a final project for *Domain Specific Languages* course thaught by Prof. [Igor Dejanović](https://github.com/igordejanovic "Igor Dejanović's GitHub profile") on master studies at *Software Engineering and Informational Technologies* study programme at Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Serbia.
